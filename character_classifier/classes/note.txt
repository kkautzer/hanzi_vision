this folder should be populated with some form of mapping between class names and IDs
based on each model's training set (`data/filtered/top-*`)

** for each data subset, there should be a corresponding class mapping in this folder **

this mapping should be loaded instead of looking to the `filtered` directory, since this 
would be substantially more time- and resource-efficient
